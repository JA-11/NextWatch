        //    If I am correct, this class will only exist for testing purposes before we integrate the API - I believe we will actually only need to store information in the
        //    WatchListMovieId objects, as A) the API can give us the movie Ids, B) the movie Ids only point to something from the API, C) We don't need a persistent store of
        //    literally just Ids on our end. Later, I will likely delete the Initial Migrations completely and start fresh when we integrate the API.
        //
        //    Not sure yet though.
